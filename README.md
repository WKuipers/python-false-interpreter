## python-false-interpreter
Python 2 Interpreter for the False language, made to supplement a project about this language.
It can also generate a LaTeX prooftree for any program it has executed. 

##Installation
Clone the repository and simply run Interpreter.py. Some examples are included.
Some examples are rather huge programs, and as such you might want to use the --recursionlimit parameter to allow more recursion

##Usage
Run Interpreter -h to see all parameters.
